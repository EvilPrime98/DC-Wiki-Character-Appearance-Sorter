# DC-Wiki-Character-Appearance-Sorter
The DC Wiki Character Appearance Sorter is a Python program that scrapes the DC Wiki website to retrieve all appearances of a specific character and sorts 
them by year and month of publication. Unlike the default alphabetical order on the DC Wiki, this program allows you to view the character's appearances in 
chronological order, making it easier to track their evolution and story arcs. The program's code is basic but functional, and can be improved upon by other 
programmers. However, it may encounter some limitations when dealing with characters that have over 400 appearances listed across multiple pages or rare cases 
where link structures differ.
